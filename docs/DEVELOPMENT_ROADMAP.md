# 10. Phase 06 — AI Assistant

## Objective

Add a secure, read-only AI assistant.

## Scope

Implement:

- AI service
- AI provider abstraction
- Claude provider
- Gemini provider where configured
- AI chat endpoint

- Message storage
- Controlled inventory tools

Initial tools:

```text
searchProducts
getProduct
getInventory
getLowStockProducts
getOutOfStockProducts
getInventorySummary
getInventoryHistory
getProductsByLocation
```

## AI Security

AI must:

- Receive authenticated user context.
- Inherit user permissions.
- Respect business isolation.
- Use controlled tools.
- Never access MongoDB directly.
- Never receive MongoDB credentials.
- Never execute arbitrary database queries.

## V1 AI Restrictions

AI is READ-ONLY.

The AI cannot:

```text
Create product
Update product
Delete product
Modify inventory
Create stock transaction
Modify users
Change roles
```

## AI Accuracy

Database facts must come from tool results.

The AI must not invent:

- Quantities
- Products
- Stock levels
- Locations
- Transaction history

## Definition of Done

Example questions work:

```text
"What products are low in stock?"

"How many products do I have?"

"How many Coca-Cola items are available?"

"Which products are out of stock?"

"Show inventory in the warehouse."

"What happened to inventory recently?"
```

AI tool authorization must be tested.

AI must not bypass business isolation.

AI must not modify inventory.

# 12. Phase Gate System

Claude Code must NOT automatically move to the next phase after completing a phase.

After every phase, produce:

```text
PHASE STATUS
────────────
Phase:
Status:

IMPLEMENTED
- ...

FILES CHANGED
- ...

TESTS
- ...

VERIFICATION
- ...

ISSUES
- ...

SPECIFICATION CONFLICTS
- ...

REMAINING WORK
- ...

RECOMMENDED NEXT PHASE
- ...
```

The project owner decides whether to proceed.

---

# 13. Change Control

If Claude discovers that the current specification is incomplete or incorrect:

Do NOT silently redesign the system.

Instead:

1. Identify the issue.
2. Explain why it matters.
3. Propose a solution.
4. Explain affected components.
5. Wait for approval before making major architectural changes.

Minor implementation improvements that do not alter architectural decisions may be applied normally.

---

# 14. Bug Handling

If a bug is discovered during a phase:

### If related to the current phase

Fix it before declaring the phase complete.

### If unrelated to the current phase

Do not immediately expand scope.

Report it as:

```text
Unrelated issue discovered:
...
Recommended future phase:
...
```

Only fix it immediately if it blocks the current phase.

---

# 15. Refactoring Rules

Refactoring is allowed when it:

- Improves maintainability
- Fixes architectural problems
- Removes duplication
- Improves security
- Improves testability

However:

Do not perform large unrelated refactors during feature implementation.

Keep changes focused.

---

# 16. Dependency Rules

Before adding a dependency:

1. Determine whether the feature actually requires it.
2. Check whether an existing dependency already provides the functionality.
3. Prefer established and maintained libraries.
4. Avoid unnecessary packages.
5. Explain significant new dependencies.

Do not add dependencies simply for convenience.

---

# 17. Git Checkpoints

A Git commit should be created after a stable phase.

Recommended:

```text
phase 00: planning complete
phase 01: foundation complete
phase 02: backend database complete
phase 03: authentication authorization complete
phase 04: inventory core complete
phase 05: mobile application complete
phase 06: AI assistant complete
phase 07: production hardening complete
```

Before committing:

- Run relevant checks.
- Review changed files.
- Verify no secrets are included.
- Confirm scope is correct.

---

# 18. V1 Completion

V1 is complete only when all major requirements in:

`docs/SYSTEM_SPECIFICATION.md`

have been implemented and verified.

The final V1 workflow must work:

```text
Register
   ↓
Create Business
   ↓
Login
   ↓
Create Location
   ↓
Create Category
   ↓
Create Product
   ↓
Stock In
   ↓
Inventory Updated
   ↓
Transaction Recorded
   ↓
Stock Out
   ↓
Inventory Updated
   ↓
Transaction Recorded
   ↓
Dashboard Updated
   ↓
AI Inventory Questions
```

---

# 19. Future Development

After V1, future features must be planned separately.

Potential V2:

- Barcode/QR scanner
- Push notifications
- Supplier management
- Stock transfers
- Advanced reports
- Document upload
- RAG
- MongoDB Vector Search

Potential V3:

- AI forecasting
- Demand prediction
- Purchase recommendations
- Automated alerts
- AI-assisted actions

Potential V4:

- Multi-business SaaS
- Subscriptions
- Billing
- Team management
- AI usage quotas

Future functionality must not be implemented during V1 unless explicitly approved.

---

# 20. Final Development Rule

The goal is not to produce the largest amount of code as quickly as possible.

The goal is to produce a:

- Secure
- Correct
- Maintainable
- Testable
- Scalable
- Production-ready

inventory management system.

Every phase must leave the project in a better and verifiable state than before.
