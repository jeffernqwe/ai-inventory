/**
 * Account deletion — the screen and its credential choice.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. Deletion is the one irreversible action in the app, and the
 * screen is where a person meets three rules that must not silently change:
 *
 *   1. NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL THE WORD IS TYPED. The destructive button is disabled until
 *      the confirmation matches `DELETE`, and a blank or mistyped value is refused before
 *      a request is made — the server's budget is not spent on an accidental tap.
 *   2. THE CREDENTIAL IS THE ONE THE ACCOUNT HAS. A Firebase-linked account sends an ID
 *      token and is NOT asked for a password; a legacy account sends its password and no
 *      token. Neither is inferred from anything the person types.
 *   3. A REFUSAL IS SHOWN, NOT A SIGN-OUT. The last-owner 409, the wrong-password 400 and
 *      the no-identity case all leave the session intact; only a 401 ends it.
 *
 * `lib/auth` and `lib/api` are mocked; the screen composes the real Button, Card, Input,
 * Banner, Screen and theme, so the rendering asserted here is the shipped one.
