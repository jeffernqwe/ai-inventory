/**
 * After a draft is created, the member lands on it (§27CZ).
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `submit()` ended with `router.back()` for both create and edit, so creating a draft dismissed the
 * form to **whatever was underneath it**. From the list that is the list — the draft is one more tap away, and the
 * success alert's own advice ("issue it when you're ready") is two. From a **deep link** there is nothing
 * underneath at all: §27CX's device pass created a draft through `inventoryai://purchase-orders/new` and the alert
 * dismissed to the **AI hub**, with the order it had just made nowhere on screen. The write was correct in every
 * case; only the destination was arbitrary.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED HERE
 *
 *   - create **replaces** the form with the new draft's detail (`/purchase-orders/<id>`), using the id the
 *     server returns with its 201 — and does not *also* pop the stack, because back must go to the list rather
 *     than to a second copy of the create form;
 *   - edit still goes **back** to the detail it was opened from, where the change is re-read on focus;
 *   - a create response without an id (nothing the server sends, but the fallback exists) still leaves the app
 *     somewhere sane;
 *   - the client-side mirror blocks an empty form **before** any request, so an obviously-invalid order never
 *     spends a round trip;
 *   - a server field error and a server code error both reach the member as copy rather than as a raw code.
 *
 * This is the first suite for `PoForm`, which is the write path for purchase orders — the screen §27CX exercised
 * by hand and nothing exercised by machine.
