/**
 * Delete my account (2026-10-24).
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN IS DELIBERATELY UNFRIENDLY. Deletion is irreversible for the person
 * and partially irreversible for the business's history, so it asks for three separate
 * things rather than one tap: the destructive action named in words, the typed word
 * DELETE, and a re-authentication credential. None of that is the security boundary —
 * the server re-checks all of it and derives the account from the session — but a screen
 * that made this easy to do by accident would be a worse screen.
 *
 * WHAT IT TELLS THE PERSON BEFORE THEY COMMIT. Exactly what goes (name, address,
 * password, Firebase identity, sessions, reset codes, assistant conversations) and what
 * stays (the business's own stock history and audit trail, with their identity removed).
 * A deletion prompt that only says "are you sure?" asks somebody to trust a summary they
 * cannot see.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT KNOW WHETHER THE ACCOUNT IS FIREBASE-LINKED. The server publishes
 * `authMethods`, and the screen reads the `firebase` capability from it: true means the
 * identity provider will be asked to confirm, false means a password field is shown.
 * The decision is never inferred from an email domain or a provider name.
 *
 * THE REFUSALS ARE NOT SIGN-OUTS. A wrong word, wrong password, mismatched identity and
 * the last-owner 409 are all shown here, and the session stays. Only a 401 — the session
 * genuinely gone — ends it, which `isSessionError` decides.
