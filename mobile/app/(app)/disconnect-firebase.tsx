/**
 * Phase A (F-1) — CHANGING the account's Firebase password.
 *
 * IT NO LONGER DISCONNECTS ANYTHING. Until Phase A this screen detached the account's
 * the caller's own account (which the session already proves) AND the Firebase
 * authentication must be RECENT — the verified token's `auth_time` within 300 s.
 * A person signed in hours ago satisfies the first and not the second, so the
 * confirmation is not an edge case to handle reactively; it is the normal first
 * step, and putting it FIRST is also what keeps a typed password from being held in
 * memory across a browser round-trip that can background or kill the app.
 *
 *   1. Choose how this account signs in to Firebase, and confirm it.
 *   2. Type the new password that will own the account afterwards.
 *   3. Firebase changes the credential, the server withdraws every session minted
 *      against the old one — including the one this screen is using — and the app
 *      immediately takes the one fresh session the sequence ends with.
 *
 * STEP 2 CAN HAPPEN TWICE, which is why it is a step and not a button. The server owns
 * a 300 s freshness window, so it can refuse the whole request with
 * `FIREBASE_REAUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` — an instruction, not a verdict, and the only
 * refusal this flow retries. When it does, the flow returns to step 1, the typed
 * password is DISCARDED rather than held, and the person confirms their sign-in again
 * before typing a new one. Exactly one such retry is made.
 *
 * NOTHING SENSITIVE TRAVELS THROUGH NAVIGATION. There is no route parameter at all:
 * the screen reads what it needs from the session, the confirmation token never
 * leaves a callback inside `lib/auth.tsx`, and the typed passwords live in this
 * component's state alone. The email is DISPLAYED from the authenticated user's own
 * record and is never an input — so a person cannot steer the confirmation toward an
 * identity that is not theirs, and no email is ever compared to anything.
 *
 * THE CHOICE IS THE PERSON'S, NOT THE APP'S. The server publishes no provider data
 * (Phase 32F decision R-4), and the only Firebase API that could discover a
 * provider from an email is deprecated and discouraged, so nothing here tries to
 * guess. A wrong guess is not a security problem — the server compares the verified
 * token's uid with the account's stored `firebaseUid` and refuses a mismatch — it is
 * simply a wrong door, which is why every wrong-door answer here points at the
 * other one.
