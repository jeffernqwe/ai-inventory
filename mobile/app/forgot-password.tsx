/**
 * Request a six-digit password-reset code (AUTH-06). PUBLIC — a sibling of login/register,
 * deliberately outside the `(app)` group, so it renders whether or not a session exists.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY. This screen used to ask Firebase to email a reset LINK, and a build with
 * no Firebase configuration fell back to the custom 26B endpoint. Both are gone from this path:
 *
 *   * the link's destination could no longer be configured — the project's email-template editor
 *     refuses every write (`EMAIL_TEMPLATE_UPDATE_NOT_ALLOWED`) — so the "return to the app" half
 *     of that design was unbuildable; and
 *   * even when Firebase's email does arrive, it leads to a BROWSER form and revokes nothing.
 *
 * The server now mints and mails the code itself (through Brevo, the provider already used for the
 * account-verification code), and the next screen takes the code and the new password. So this
 * screen sends ONE request, has ONE path, and cannot end in a browser.
 *
 * THE SUCCESS STATE IS A NAVIGATION, NOT A MESSAGE, because the code screen is where the journey
 * actually continues — and it opens for an unknown address exactly as it opens for a known one,
 * which is what keeps the request path enumeration-proof end to end.
 *
 * THE RESPONSE BODY IS NEVER READ. The server answers one 202 and one sentence whether or not the
 * address exists, and whether or not the mail was delivered (the send is detached). Rendering that
 * body would be the one place this client could undo the guarantee, so it does not read it.
