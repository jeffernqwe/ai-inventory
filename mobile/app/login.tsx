 * Phase 32E — the one server outcome this screen must do more than print.
 *
 * `POST /api/auth/firebase/exchange` answers `REGISTRATION_REQUIRED` when the
 * identity authenticated with Firebase but has no Inventory AI account yet. The
 * server's message tells the user to create a business account, and this is the
 * screen that has to make that actionable — the message names a journey, so the
 * journey needs a control. It is rendered in the INFO tone rather than the error
 * tone: the credentials were accepted, and nothing the user did was wrong.
 *
 * Phase 32J: the control leads to `/register-firebase`, NOT `/register`. The
 * identity that produced this refusal is already authenticated with Firebase and
 * is still signed in, so sending the user to the email/password form would ask
 * them for an email they already proved and a password that would create a SECOND
 * Firebase identity — and then refuse to register either of them. The Firebase
 * onboarding screen asks only for the business name, and the identity it registers
 * is read from the Firebase layer rather than carried here, so no token, uid or
 * email travels through this link.
 *
 * Every other refusal (ACCOUNT_DISABLED, BUSINESS_NOT_ACTIVE,
 * FIREBASE_SIGN_IN_REQUIRED, INVALID_CREDENTIALS) is a statement with nothing to
 * press and is shown as an ordinary error banner.
