/**
 * Phase 32J — onboarding for an identity Firebase has ALREADY authenticated.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN EXISTS AND `/register` COULD NOT DO THE JOB. `REGISTRATION_REQUIRED`
 * is answered by `POST /api/auth/firebase/exchange` for an identity that Firebase
 * verified but that owns no Inventory AI account. That identity is signed in to
 * Firebase at the moment of the refusal, and it is the ONLY thing that may be
 * registered — so the remaining question is a business name. The email/password
 * form asks for an email the user has just proved and a password that would cause
 * `ensureFirebaseAccount` to mint a SECOND Firebase identity, which the server then
 * refuses (`EMAIL_IN_USE`) or which simply is not the identity that was
 * authenticated. Neither outcome can produce a tenant.
 *
 * This screen therefore collects exactly what is missing:
 *
 *   required  businessName
 *   optional  name
 *
 * It collects no email, no password, no confirmation, and nothing that could be
 * mistaken for an identity or an authorization claim. The identity is not a field
 * of anything here — it is read from the Firebase Auth layer inside
 * `completeFirebaseRegistration` (lib/auth.tsx), so no token, uid or email is held
 * by this component, passed as a route parameter, or persisted anywhere.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never links the identity to an existing account: a 409
 * `EMAIL_IN_USE` is reported and the user is pointed at Sign in, because Phase 32H
 * requires an explicit authenticated link over an existing session rather than an
 * address match. It also never retries registration to recover from a failed
 * exchange — the context resumes at the exchange, so a retry cannot create a second
 * business.
