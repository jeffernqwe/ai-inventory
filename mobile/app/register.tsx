/**
 * Create Account, in two shapes.
 *
 * ORDINARY: a person starts a business, so the form asks for its name and the server
 * creates a Business with them as its OWNER.
 *
 * INVITED (2026-10-25): `app/invite.tsx` has already stored the invitation in memory and
 * sent the person here. The business and the role come from that invitation row, so the
 * form asks for neither — it names what they are joining instead. The email is PREFILLED
 * AND LOCKED, because the server checks the invited address against the verified
 * Firebase identity: letting it be edited would only produce a refusal after a six-digit
 * code had been typed. Everything else — the password, the confirmation, the name — is
 * the person's own, which is the point of an invitation: nobody else chooses their
 * credential.
