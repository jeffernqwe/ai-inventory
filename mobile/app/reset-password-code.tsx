/**
 * AUTH-06 (two-step recovery) — STEP ONE: verify the emailed reset code.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCREEN EXISTS. Firebase's reset email can no longer be pointed at a destination we
 * choose — the project's email-template editor refuses every write
 * (`EMAIL_TEMPLATE_UPDATE_NOT_ALLOWED`) — so the "click a link, finish in a browser" journey is
 * both unconfigurable and, when it works, a browser form that revokes nothing. The code arrives by
 * email, the person types it here, and the rest happens inside the app.
 *
 * IT ASKS FOR THE CODE AND NOTHING ELSE. The new password lives on the next screen, because two
 * questions on one form made the journey read as one long step and made a wrong code and a
 * rejected password indistinguishable in the same error slot. This screen has one job, one field
 * and one button.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER CARRIES. The code lives in this component's state and leaves only in the request
 * body; it is never rendered back, logged, persisted or put in a route param. On success the
 * server's short-lived authorization is handed to `lib/passwordResetSession` — memory, not
 * navigation state — and the next screen reads it from there. The only route parameter is the
 * ADDRESS, which the person typed on the previous screen and which identifies no account on its
 * own: the server resolves the account from the challenge the code belongs to.
 *
 * A VERIFIED CODE IS SPENT. The server refuses to verify the same code twice, so a person who
 * leaves this journey after verifying asks for a new code; the resend control here is exactly that
 * route, and it starts a fresh challenge which supersedes the old one.
