/**
 * AUTH-04-F — the email-verification screen, now the CUSTOM 6-DIGIT CODE flow.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. An identity Firebase has authenticated but whose address is not verified
 * owns no Inventory AI User and therefore no session, so it never reaches the `(app)`
 * group (whose layout redirects anyone who is not signed in). It is held here instead.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It never carries a token, uid or email: the identity is read from
 * the Firebase layer inside `lib/auth.tsx`, the business details come from the in-memory
 * onboarding state, and the code leaves this screen only in the body of the confirm
 * request. It never signs anyone in by itself — only a server-issued session does, and the
 * signedIn guard below is what leaves this screen. No route parameter is read.
 *
 * THREE STATES, decided entirely by the in-memory onboarding value:
 *
 *   'none'               nothing is waiting -> Login (a redirect, not a dead end).
 *   'verify-unreachable' a persisted identity exists but its state could not be read ->
 *                        the safe unreachable state: Try Again + Wrong account? Sign out.
 *   'verify-email'       the code form.
 *
 * THE CODE FLOW. "Send verification code" (or "Resend code" once one has been sent) asks
 * the AUTH-04 request endpoint for a fresh six-digit code; the code is mailed by the
 * server and never returned to this app. "Verify" submits it to the confirm endpoint, and
 * on success the context reloads Firebase, mints a forced-refresh token, registers a
 * pending tenant, and exchanges — after which the signedIn guard redirects away.
 *
 * THE RESEND COOLDOWN IS THE SERVER'S NUMBER. A 429 carries `Retry-After`, which is read
 * verbatim; a successful send starts the server's documented 60-second window locally, so
 * the button cannot be used to earn a guaranteed immediate 429. Nothing here invents a
 * cooldown length.
 *
 * A CODE MAY ALREADY HAVE BEEN SENT WHEN THIS SCREEN OPENS. Registration requests one
 * before it navigates, so `verificationCodeIssuedAt` (in-memory context state) says so and
 * the screen opens with the truthful subtitle, the "Resend" wording and the remainder of
 * the server's window already counting down. A sign-in for an unverified identity passes
 * `null`, and then the screen correctly says a code will be sent rather than pretending
 * one already was.
