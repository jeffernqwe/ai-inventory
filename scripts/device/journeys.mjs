 * `validateJourneys` rejects a misspelt or doubled verb instead of letting the step quietly do
 * nothing. `server/test/device-harness.test.mjs` runs that check over this file on every CI run.
 *
 * WHAT A JOURNEY IS FOR. These replace the hand-written adb tap sequences a device pass used to be:
 * the same screens, in the same order, asserted from the accessibility tree, with screenshots and a
 * report left behind. They are not a substitute for judgement — a journey cannot tell you a screen
 * looks wrong, only that its text is where it should be.
 *
 * THE ROUTES ARE DEEP LINKS the app already supports (`inventoryai://<route>`), which is why a run
 * needs no coordinate guessing: navigation is by route, and every interaction is by the label a
 * person would read.

 * because all 17 assertions were headings. The `expectData` steps below are the half that can fail:
 * each one waits for a label the client cannot invent — a stock row's `available · on hand`
 * arithmetic, a product row's SKU or barcode — and fails if the screen lands in its error state
 * first. An empty tenant blocks the step instead (`nothing to prove`), never passes it.
 *
 * The other five screens are covered by `expectClean` instead, because they may legitimately be
 * EMPTY on a fresh tenant (no purchase orders, no suppliers, no restock candidates, no audit yet):
 * it waits for the screen to stop loading and fails if it stopped on the app's error state, so a
 * refusal is caught on every screen without needing data to exist.
