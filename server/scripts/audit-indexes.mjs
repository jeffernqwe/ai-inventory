// `npm run audit:indexes` — compare every DECLARED index against the indexes that
// actually EXIST in the connected database.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Four increments shipped performance or lifecycle behaviour whose
// entire payoff rests on a database index: Phase 20G/20H (the list-sort keys),
// Phase 22/AI-3 (the inventory page sort `{ businessId, updatedAt: -1, _id: -1 }`),
// and the session/reset/challenge TTL keys (which are what actually expire rows).
// Each of those is guarded by a suite — but those suites read the MODEL SOURCE, so
// they can only prove an index is DECLARED. They cannot fail if the database never
// built it, and the build path is Mongoose's default `autoIndex`, which runs in the
// background at connect time and is asserted nowhere:
// `grep -rn "autoIndex\|syncIndexes\|createIndexes" src/ scripts/` finds nothing.
//
// This is the missing half: it asks the DATABASE. A declared index that is absent is
// a defect no unit suite, no typecheck and no green CI run would ever surface — the
// application keeps working and simply pays for it — which is exactly how both a
// performance regression and an unbounded-collection leak hide.
//
// READ-ONLY. It never creates, drops or modifies anything, and it deliberately does
// NOT call `syncIndexes()`: that can DROP indexes it does not recognise, including
// one an operator added on purpose to a shared database. Drift is reported for an
// operator to resolve.
//
// Coverage is by construction: the model list is `src/models/index.ts`'s own `models`
// array, so a newly added model is audited without touching this file.
//
// EXIT CODES, AND THE THREE OUTCOMES THEY MUST KEEP APART — this is the file's
// contract, because it is meant to gate a check without anyone parsing output:
//
//   0  the audit ran and every declaration matches the database
//   1  the audit ran to COMPLETION and found a declaration/database disagreement
//   2  NOT VERIFIED — the audit could not complete, so NOTHING was checked
//
// Exit 1 is a claim about the database, so it may only ever be the second of those.
// It used to be the third as well, because the catch-all handler below exited 1 for
// an unreachable database — and that is the worst false report THIS tool can make,
// since the remedy a reader then reaches for is `syncIndexes()`, which the paragraph
// above explains can destroy an index an operator added on purpose. Reproduced for
// real on 2026-10-14: a `connect ETIMEDOUT` exited 1, reading exactly like drift.
