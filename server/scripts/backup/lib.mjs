// OPS-1 — the backup and restore core.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-10-18 the deployed cluster was an Atlas M0 (512 MB) and
// MongoDB's own documentation is unambiguous: "Atlas backups are not available for
// Free clusters… you may use mongodump to back up your Free cluster data". Nothing
// in this repository provided that dump, so the production database had NO recoverable
// copy of any kind — not a stale one, none. This module is the recoverable copy.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a mock of Atlas snapshots. It writes one gzipped
// Extended-JSON file per collection plus a manifest carrying each file's SHA-256, so
// a restore can prove it is reading the bytes that were written rather than trusting
// a filename. That matters because the failure mode of a backup is silent: a dump
// truncated by a dropped connection still looks like a backup until the day it is
// needed.
//
// Three rules shape everything below:
//
//   1. A BACKUP IS READ-ONLY. `createBackup` only reads; it cannot modify, drop or
//      index anything. That is why it is allowed to point at production while the
//      restore path is not.
//   2. A RESTORE IS DESTRUCTIVE, SO IT IS FAIL-CLOSED. It may only target the
//      databases this repository already treats as disposable (`test`, `dev` — the
//      same allowlist `cleanup/lib.mjs` owns, imported rather than copied so the two
//      cannot drift), it verifies EVERY file's hash before it drops ANY collection,
//      and it requires an explicit confirmation phrase.
//   3. A BACKUP NEVER LIVES IN THE REPOSITORY. A dump is a copy of real customer data;
//      written under the repo it is one `git add -A` away from being committed, so the
//      path is checked against the project root and refused.
//
// The functions here take an already-connected database handle, which is what makes
// them testable without spawning a CLI or touching the network policy: the round-trip
// suite passes `mongoose.connection.db`.
