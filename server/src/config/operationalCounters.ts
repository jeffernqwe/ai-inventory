/**
 * OPS-2 — the deployment's own pulse.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every failure this project has paid for was found by a person looking: a stale
 * server (§27CW), a provider limit spent at 02:00 (§27CJ), five assistant tools broken for two days
 * at 131 000 products (§27DF), a database whose writes were blocked by a storage quota while the
 * process still reported `ready` (§27DF). The logs carry all of it and **nothing watches them** — so
 * the gap this closes is not measurement, it is **a signal an outside watcher can read without
 * credentials, without reading logs, and without trusting the same process that is failing**.
 *
 * WHAT IS PUBLISHED, AND WHY SO LITTLE. Three integers and a timestamp, on the legacy `/api/health`
 * endpoint that already publishes the commit id: total responses, responses by status class, and how
 * many of them were 5xx with the last one's time. Deliberately NOT published: paths, request ids,
 * user or tenant identifiers, durations, error messages, and the request rate as a window. A count
 * since boot with no names attached tells an uptime check **that something is failing now**, which is
 * exactly the question it is polled to answer, and tells nobody who is using the product. Findings
 * stay in the logs, where they already are, behind credentials.
 *
 * WHY 5xx AND NOT 4xx. A 4xx is the API working — the caller sent something it would not accept. A
 * 5xx is the API failing, and it is the only class worth waking someone for. Counting them separately
 * is what makes an alert rule possible at all.
 *
 * WHY A COLLAPSE IS MEASURED FROM BOOT. These are process-local and reset when the process does, which
 * is honest for one instance and misleading for several: four instances each report their own counts,
 * and a watcher polling one of them sees one quarter of the traffic. That is the limit of this
 * implementation, stated here rather than discovered later — a shared counter needs a shared store,
 * which this project does not have (the same reason B2 and E3 are deferred, §29). For a single
 * deployed instance — which is what is running today — it is the whole picture.
 *
 * Memory is bounded by construction: fixed keys, integers, one timestamp. Nothing here grows with
 * traffic, and nothing here can be made to grow by a caller.
