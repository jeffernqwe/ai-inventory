  // Phase 26B-2 — password recovery. Two events, not one: a link was issued,
  // and a password was actually replaced through one. They are different facts
  // about the account and an investigator needs to tell them apart (a request
  // that was never completed is the shape of a probe; a completion with no
  // request is impossible). Both use AUDIT_ENTITY_TYPES.USER, so no entity type

  // Phase 32H — Firebase identity linking. TWO events, not four, and the
  // omission is deliberate rather than an oversight.
  //
  // LINKED records the one durable outcome: the caller's own account adopted a
  // verified Firebase identity. LINK_CONFLICT records the refusal — a verified
  // identity that already belongs to another account, or an account that
  // already owns a different identity. They are the two facts an investigator
  // needs to tell apart: an adoption, and a blocked adoption.
  //
  // The brief's other candidates are absent for a structural reason rather than
  // a policy one. "Attempted cross-business linking" and "attempted role
  // manipulation" cannot be observed here at all: `validateFirebaseLink` returns
  // only `idToken`, so a body carrying `businessId` or `role` is indistinguishable
  // from a body carrying any other unknown key, and there is no value to detect.
  // "Unauthenticated linking" is refused by `requireAuth` before any handler runs,
  // so no `businessId` exists to attribute a row to — and `recordAudit` requires
  // one. The control for all three is structural, and an audit row is not what
  // makes it hold.

  // business's governance record still shows that an account was closed, when, and
  // under which role, without identifying the person afterwards.

  // Invitation-based onboarding (2026-10-25). Three events, one per transition the
  // admin or the invitee can cause. They are separate rather than a single
  // INVITATION_UPDATED because the trail's value here is telling a grant that was
  // declined from one that was used: a REVOKED row is somebody withdrawing an offer,
  // an ACCEPTED row is a new member. The address is NOT in any metadata — the same
  // rule the account-deletion work established, so a later deletion cannot leave a
