 * declaring `user` on Express's global `Request` would let any module read an
 * authoritative-looking `req.user` on a public route.
 *
 * `user` is optional, matching `middlewares/authorize.ts` exactly, because a
 * handler is registered against Express's `RequestHandler`, whose parameter is a
 * plain `Request`; a required `user` would make that `Request` unassignable and
 * every route registration a type error. The reads below assert it with `!`
 * instead, which is justified by the route table: every route in
 * `routes/purchase-orders.routes.ts` is registered `requireAuth,
 * requirePermission(...), controller` — a binding Phase 22 pins — so the
 * middleware has always run by the time these handlers execute. Optional
 * chaining was NOT used: it would silently pass `undefined` on where the code
 * would previously have thrown, which is a behaviour change.
