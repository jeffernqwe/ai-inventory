/**
 * Public auth-endpoint rate limiting (Phase 07B / H1, extended by Phase 26B-3).
 *
 * login, register and the password-recovery routes are the unauthenticated write
 * endpoints, so they are the vectors for credential stuffing, password spraying,
 * brute force, mass account creation, reset-mail flooding and reset-token
 * guessing. They get dedicated limiters (stricter than the rest of the API, which
 * has none).
 *
 * Since the 2026-10-23 security audit, three AUTHENTICATED operations are limited
 * as well — change-password, firebase/link and credentials-changed — because each
 * one spends a credential comparison or a Firebase verification per call, and
 * change-password's comparison is the only re-authentication that endpoint
 * performs. Those are keyed on `req.user.id` (the server-derived account), not on
 * anything the caller supplies, and are mounted AFTER requireAuth.
 *
 *   login   -> two stacked limiters:
 *               1) per IP + normalized-email bucket, strict (targeted brute
 *                  force against one account). Only FAILED attempts consume
 *                  the budget (`skipSuccessfulRequests`), so legitimate users
 *                  are never locked out by their own successes.
 *               2) per-IP bucket with a higher cap (password spraying across
 *                  many accounts from one source).
 *   register -> per-IP bucket, counting every attempt. Keying registration by
 *               the unique email would let bots bypass it by cycling emails.
 *
 * Limits are read from the environment at limiter-creation time (same lazy
 * pattern as services/ai/aiConfig.js) so operators can tune them without code
 * changes, and each factory returns a FRESH limiter with its own in-memory
 * store — mounting a new router (see createAuthRouter in routes/auth.routes.js)
 * gives isolated stores, which tests use to keep runs deterministic.
 *
 * Responses follow the project's error shape ({ error, code }) and never
 * include passwords, hashes, tokens, or internal details. In-memory stores are
 * process-local: a multi-instance / serverless deployment needs a shared store
 * (e.g. Redis) — out of scope for V1, documented in the wiki of this library.

//   * AN IDENTITY-KEYED BUCKET. The spec says "if a stable key exists". At the

//     itself — which an attacker rotates freely and a legitimate client replaces
//     every hour, so keying on it would bound nothing while giving every rotation
//     a fresh budget. A per-identity cap therefore needs a counter written AFTER
//     verification, inside the request, which is new mechanism rather than the
//     reuse §15 asks for. It is left out rather than faked, and the per-IP buckets
//     below are the address-rotation backstop the same section names.
//   * `REGISTRATION_REQUIRED` IS COUNTED, NOT SKIPPED — which is why the omission
//     above matters here too. It is a legitimate outcome and a 403, so a limiter
//     that skipped 4xx, or that counted only successes, would leave the
//     "which Firebase identities exist" surface §15 names unbounded.

// "you are being throttled on verification", not which bucket caught it.

// Everything above this line protects a route a caller reaches WITHOUT a session, which is why
// every key in it is derived from something the caller supplies. The three inline limiters below
// are the other half: they sit behind `requireAuth`, so the account is already established and
// `req.user.id` is a server-derived fact rather than a claim. Keying on it is what makes the
// budget belong to the ACCOUNT, so rotating addresses buys no fresh budget on the two per-account
// limiters. The change-password strict bucket is the ONE exception: it joins the account with the
// client address, so a different address does buy a fresh ten there. That is deliberate — an
// account-wide bucket would let anyone already holding a session for the account keep the victim's
// OWN password change refused for the window — and the per-address bucket below still bounds a
// single source (thirty per fifteen minutes). Checklist §52 records the N×10 consequence.
//
// THEY ARE DELIBERATELY NOT ENFORCED BEFORE AUTHENTICATION. Each is mounted after requireAuth, so
// an anonymous caller is answered 401 and never spends (or is refused by) a bucket it has no
// identity to own. That is the same ordering AUTH-03's `/renew` uses, and the Phase 23 classifier
// treats "requireAuth + limiter + controller" as AUTHENTICATED rather than gated.
//
// THE CODES ARE DISTINCT PER OPERATION rather than one shared `*_RATE_LIMITED`, because the
// remedies differ in wording for a human reading the sentence: "too many password changes" and
// "too many attempts to connect this sign-in" are different things to say, and the mobile client
// displays `error.message` for a 429 on every one of these screens.
