 * One ordered product line. Snapshot productName/sku at order time so the PO
 * keeps its own record if the product is later renamed or archived. quantityReceived
 * starts at 0 and is only ever increased by receiving (Phase 13C) — never edited.
 *
 * quantityCommitted is the claim-first receiving counter: quantity durably received
 * PLUS quantity held by in-flight receive claims (reservations that have won the PO
 * race but whose inventory movement + final receipt may not have landed yet). At rest
 * quantityCommitted == quantityReceived and `claims` is empty; while a receive is
 * mid-flight a line can have quantityCommitted > quantityReceived. It exists because a
 * cross-field `quantityReceived + claimed <= quantityOrdered` guard is not expressible
 * in Mongo arrayFilters/$elemMatch — a single filterable scalar is. quantityReceived
 * itself must stay durable/receipt-linked (it drives auto-RECEIVED and reconciliation),
 * so claims reserve in this separate counter, never in quantityReceived.
