/**
 * Self-service account deletion (Google Play account-deletion requirement).
 *
 * WHAT DELETION MEANS HERE. The person's account is closed and their personal
 * information is removed, but the row that their business's records already point
 * at is NOT hard-deleted: audit rows, inventory transactions, purchase orders and
 * the AI usage history all carry a `userId`/`entityId`, and erasing the row would
 * turn those into dangling references — which would falsify an inventory history
 * that other members of the same business still rely on. So the user row becomes a
 * TOMBSTONE:
 *
 *   - `status: 'DELETED'` and `deletedAt` — every authentication path already
 *     refuses a status that is not ACTIVE, so the account can never be signed into
 *     again, and `users.service` never lists or edits it;
 *   - `name: 'Deleted user'` — the only human-readable personal field;
 *   - `email` replaced by a unique, non-routable placeholder
 *     (`deleted+<id>@deleted.invalid`), which frees the real address AND keeps the
 *     unique index intact. It is deliberately in the reserved `.invalid` TLD, so it
 *     can never be delivered to;
 *   - `firebaseUid` and `passwordHash` UNSET — no identity linkage and no credential
 *     survives;
 *   - `emailVerified: false`, `passwordChangedAt: now` — a belt-and-braces
 *     invalidation of any token minted before this moment.
 *
 * The Firebase identity itself is deleted BEFORE the tombstone is written. That
 * order matters: Firebase is the identity provider, so leaving the identity alive
 * would keep accepting the person's password and land them on
 * `REGISTRATION_REQUIRED` — a deleted account that is still a usable identity.
 * Writing the tombstone last also makes the whole operation converge on retry: a
 * crash after the Firebase delete leaves an ACTIVE row that a second request can
 * still tombstone, and the second Firebase delete is answered as already-gone.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELETED OUTRIGHT. Everything that holds personal content and is not part
 * of the business's inventory record: the person's sessions (all devices), their
 * password-reset tokens and reset challenges, their email-verification challenge,
 * their AI conversations and the messages inside them. Audit rows are KEPT but
 * ANONYMIZED (`userId: null`), because the trail is a governance record of the
 * business and the deletion itself must be visible in it; one `ACCOUNT_DELETED`
 * row is written with `userId: null` so the deletion does not re-introduce a
 * reference to the row it just anonymized.
 *
 * TENANT ISOLATION. Every filter below is derived from the loaded `User` document —
 * `_id`, `businessId`, `firebaseUid` — never from the request body. The caller is
 * `requireAuth`'s own `req.user.id`, so a request cannot name another account, and
 * the AI message deletion is scoped by conversation ids that were themselves
 * selected by this user.
 *
 * A BUSINESS WITH NOBODY ELSE LEFT IS CLOSED TOO (owner decision, 2026-10-24). The
 * inventory history argument above is about OTHER PEOPLE: rows are kept because
 * somebody else in the business still relies on them. When the caller is the only
 * active member, there is nobody — so keeping the tenant would retain personal data
 * for no one's benefit, and, worse, would leave a person permanently unable to close
 * their account (there was no invitation or ownership-transfer path to satisfy a
 * refusal). In that one case the whole tenant is removed with the account: products,
 * stock, movements, purchase orders, suppliers, locations, categories, the audit
 * trail, the assistant's history, every user row and the business row itself. THE
 * LIST OF WHAT THAT MEANS IS NOT DEFINED HERE — `tenantTeardown.service` owns it, so
 * the application and the cleanup tooling cannot drift apart.
 *
 * THE LAST-OWNER RULE, WHEN SOMEBODY REMAINS. If another active member exists, the
 * business must keep an active OWNER, so an OWNER who is the only active one is
 * refused (409 `LAST_OWNER_TRANSFER_REQUIRED`) and must transfer ownership first.
 * Another active OWNER existing is what unlocks the account-only deletion in that
 * case. Every count is scoped by `businessId` and `status: 'ACTIVE'`, so a tombstoned
 * or disabled second owner does not satisfy it.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY. The tombstone update is CONDITIONAL on `status: 'ACTIVE'`; when it
 * matches nothing — a concurrent or repeated request — the destructive work is not
 * repeated and the caller is told the account is deleted. A retry therefore cannot
 * delete a second Firebase identity, count a business's owners twice, or write a
 * second audit row.
 *
 * This module decides no HTTP status. The controller maps its errors, following the
 * same split the password-reset and Firebase services use.
