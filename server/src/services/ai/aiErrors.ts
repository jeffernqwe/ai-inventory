/**
 * AI error types. These are deliberately distinct from the general ApiError
 * envelope so the AI controller can map them to clean client responses:
 *
 *   AiNotConfigured  -> 503 AI_NOT_CONFIGURED (operator must configure the server)
 *   AiProviderError  -> 502 AI_UNAVAILABLE    (transient upstream failure)
 *   AiQuotaExceeded  -> 429 AI_QUOTA_EXCEEDED (a LIMIT was reached, not an outage, AI-6)
 *   AiTimeout        -> 504 AI_TIMEOUT        (the turn outlasted its own deadline, AI-1)
 *   AiAbandoned      -> 499 AI_ABANDONED      (the CALLER went away, AI-1)
 *   AiOutputLimit    -> 502 AI_OUTPUT_LIMIT   (the model spent its own output budget, AI-10)
 *
 * A FAILURE CAN STILL KNOW WHAT IT COST. `AiOutputLimit` may carry the model it
 * happened on and the token spend the gateway reported, because that class is raised
 * at the one place where both are already parsed — and a spent output budget is
 * exactly the turn whose cost an operator needs. Before this, the AI-5 turn line
 * reported `in=0 out=0 model=unknown` for it (found on the device 2026-10-17), which
 * is the opposite of the truth: the model burned its entire budget. Nothing else
 * carries accounting today, so the reader stays narrow on purpose.
 *
 * No type carries secrets, stack traces, or internal URIs. Provider internals
 * (raw upstream bodies, keys) are logged server-side only.
 *
 * Each error has its OWN status and its OWN code because each failure needs a
 * different thing from the reader: configure the server, retry the service, wait,
 * stop retrying and come back later, ask for less at once. Collapsing any two of
 * them is what made a spent allowance look like a broken server (AI-6) and what
 * made a spent output budget look like one too (AI-10).
