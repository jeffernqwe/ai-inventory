/**
 * Firebase error layer, mirroring services/mail/mailErrors.ts (Phase 32B).
 *
 * Three distinct conditions, three distinct codes (the third added by AUTH-01):
 *
 *   FIREBASE_NOT_CONFIGURED — an operator problem. No Firebase service account
 *     is configured (or the SDK reports `auth/invalid-credential`), so no ID token
 *     can be verified. Nothing was attempted.
 *   FIREBASE_TOKEN_INVALID — a caller problem. The ID token was rejected by
 *     verification: expired, revoked, the user is disabled or gone, or it is
 *     structurally not a JWT.
 *   FIREBASE_UNAVAILABLE — a TRANSIENT infrastructure problem. Verification could
 *     not be completed (network, Google-side service failure, unknown code), so
 *     the credential was neither accepted nor judged. This must never be answered
 *     as a terminal token error: a valid Inventory AI session survives it.
 *
 *   The three codes stay DISJOINT and namespaced, so a client can branch on the
 *   code rather than on a status.
 *
 * Both codes are namespaced FIREBASE_* on purpose, and deliberately share no
 * spelling with any authentication or session code (AUTH_REQUIRED, INVALID_TOKEN,
 * SESSION_REVOKED, ...). An ID token rejected here is NOT a refused session, and
 * nothing downstream may treat the two alike — in particular, a caller must never
 * let FIREBASE_* reach the client's session-loss handler, which clears a session
 * on 401/403. `isFirebaseError()` is the check that boundary uses.
 *
 * Like the mail layer, neither class carries an HTTP status. Turning one into a
 * status is the controller's job (Phase 32C), which keeps this layer free of any
 * decision about how a caller is answered.

 * `reason` is a coarse, ALLOWLISTED label derived from the SDK's error code, for
 * server-side logging and diagnosis. It is the only detail this error carries,
 * and it exists because the raw upstream error must not be relayed: the same
 * reasoning that makes the mail layer discard Resend's free-text message applies
 * here — an upstream error is an exfiltration surface, and the value being
 * handled is a live credential.
 *
 * The label can never carry a TOKEN. `safeTokenReason` admits only lowercase
 * letters, digits, `/`, `_` and `-`, up to 64 characters. That excludes the `.`
 * that separates a token's segments, so a whole token can never match; and any
 * real token is far past the length bound anyway, so the two barriers are
 * independent. Both are asserted in the Phase 32B suite.
 *
 * Stated precisely, because the looser version of this claim is false: a SINGLE
 * base64url segment DOES satisfy the shape rule — the allowlist excludes `.`, not
 * the base64url alphabet. That is not a credential and cannot be replayed as one
 * (a segment carries no signature), and the only call site passes an SDK error
 * code such as `auth/id-token-expired`, never a token or part of one. The
 * guarantee this class needs — that no live credential reaches a log line — holds
 * regardless.
