/**
 * Firebase ID-token verification (Phase 32B).
 *
 * This is the ONLY place in the server where a Firebase identity enters the
 * system, and therefore the only place a `uid` can be trusted. Everything
 * downstream — the exchange endpoint (Phase 32C), the MongoDB mapping, RBAC —
 * consumes the value this module returns and must never read a `uid`, a role or a
 * businessId from a request body.
 *
 * Two things make that guarantee hold:
 *
 *   NARROWING — the raw decoded token is never handed out. `verifyFirebaseIdToken`
 *     returns a five-field allowlisted shape, so a caller cannot accidentally
 *     depend on some other claim, and adding one becomes a deliberate edit here
 *     rather than a convenience read somewhere else. Narrowing runs on EVERY
 *     path, including the test seam (see below), which is what keeps it under
 *     test — it is security-relevant code that could otherwise only ever be
 *     exercised against a live Firebase project.
 *
 *   THE SEAM — verification is dispatched through a replaceable delegate, so the
 *     whole layer is testable with no Firebase project, no network and no
 *     credentials. This mirrors the mail provider registry
 *     (services/mail/providers/index.ts): the real implementation is the default,
 *     and a test substitutes through the same entry point production uses.
 *
 * `checkRevoked` is TRUE (Phase AUTH-01, approved target architecture §9/§10).
 * Revocation checking is a security boundary: a stale or revoked Firebase
 * credential must not be able to create a new Inventory AI session. The cost is a
 * Firebase user-record lookup per verification, which is exactly why a failure to
 * complete it is classified as TRANSIENT rather than as a rejected credential —
 * see the classification note below.
 *
 * THREE CLASSES OF OUTCOME, THREE DISTINCT ERRORS (AUTH-01). A verification
 * attempt can end in (a) a genuinely bad credential (`FirebaseTokenError`),
 * (b) a temporary inability to verify (`FirebaseUnavailableError`), or (c) the
 * server's own Firebase configuration being unusable (`FirebaseNotConfigured`).
 * The classes are derived from the installed `firebase-admin` 14.5.0 sources; see
 * `firebaseErrors.ts` for the code lists and why `auth/argument-error` is NOT
 * terminal (it is also emitted for a JWKS fetch failure).
 *
 * The real path also performs two defence-in-depth checks that the SDK already
 * performs internally, so they are belt-and-braces rather than the boundary:
 * a STRUCTURAL pre-check (a value that is not three dot-separated segments is not
 * a JWT at all) and an ENVIRONMENT assertion (the verified token's `aud`/`iss` must
 * name this project). Both live on the real Admin SDK path only; the test seam
 * substitutes a decoded payload, for which a token-shape check is meaningless.

/**
 * The verified identity, and nothing else.
 *
 * `email` is nullable because the Firebase claim is: a phone-auth or
 * anonymous token carries no email. Both providers Phase 32 intends to offer
 * (email/password and Google) always supply one, so in practice this is non-null
 * — but the type states what the token can actually contain rather than what our
 * chosen providers happen to send, and deciding what to do about a null email is
 * the exchange endpoint's call (Phase 32C), not this layer's.
 *
 * `email` is lowercased to match the `users.email` field, which Mongoose stores
 * with `lowercase: true`. Normalizing here means the mapping cannot miss a match
 * because Google capitalized a letter.
 *
 * `authTime` is Phase 32L's addition, and it is the ONLY new claim the
 * credential-change security path needs: the credentials-changed bridge
 * (`services/credentialsChanged.service.ts`) is its live consumer, and the freshness
 * rule keyed on it is that bridge's. It is the signed `auth_time` — "when the user
 * authenticated", per Firebase's own token reference — as distinct from `iat`,
 * which is when THIS token was issued and moves on every hourly refresh. A
 * freshness rule keyed on `iat` would therefore accept an arbitrarily old
 * authentication, which is precisely the failure Phase 32L exists to avoid.
 *
 * It is surfaced as `number | null` rather than `number`. A token without a
 * usable `auth_time` is not an error here — the claim is absent from some token
 * shapes — so the field states what the token actually carried and leaves the
 * decision to the one consumer that needs it, which must treat `null` as "not
 * recent" and fail closed. Throwing instead would turn a claim-shape question
 * into a verification failure, which is a different statement to the caller.
