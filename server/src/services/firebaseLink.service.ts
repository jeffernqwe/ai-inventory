/**
 * Phase 32H — the Firebase identity linking boundary.
 *
 * This module answers ONE question and nothing else:
 *
 *   "May THIS authenticated Inventory AI account adopt THIS verified Firebase
 *    identity?"
 *
 * It is deliberately not a provider-linking module. Firebase's own provider
 * linking (`linkWithCredential`, "Connect Google") is performed by the FIREBASE
 * CLIENT SDK, against the signed-in Firebase user, and the Inventory AI server
 * has no part in it and no API for it. What the server owns is the half the
 * client must never be trusted with: the decision that a MongoDB `User` document
 * may carry a given `firebaseUid`, and the conflict detection that stops one
 * Firebase account from silently taking over another person's tenant.
 *
 * THE TWO HALVES OF "LINKING", KEPT APART ON PURPOSE (Phase 32H §7):
 *
 *   1. Firebase credential/provider linking — moves a provider (google.com,
 *      facebook.com) onto a Firebase account. Owned by Firebase; the Firebase
 *      UID does not change; INVENTORY AI NEVER SEES IT and this module is not
 *      involved. Nothing here fakes it.
 *   2. Inventory AI identity association — records that a Firebase UID belongs
 *      to a MongoDB user. That is this module, and only this module.
 *
 * Because the Firebase UID represents the Firebase ACCOUNT rather than one
 * provider, a Firebase account holding several providers is one `firebaseUid`
 * and therefore one MongoDB user. There is no provider-specific column, no
 * provider-specific identity, and no provider-specific session or token
 * anywhere in this design — attaching a provider must never mint a second
 * Inventory AI account, and the schema is what prevents it rather than a rule.
 *
 * WHAT THE CALLER MAY NOT SAY. `userId` and `businessId` arrive as ARGUMENTS from
 * the authenticated request context (`req.user`), never from a body — the
 * controller passes them and `validateFirebaseLink` returns no field that could
 * carry them. The uid comes from `verifyFirebaseIdToken`, which narrows a token
 * Google's signature verified. So a body carrying `firebaseUid`, `userId`,
 * `businessId`, `role` or `status` is inert by construction: there is no variable
 * in this module holding a client-supplied value.
 *
 * THE OWNERSHIP PROOF IS THE SESSION, AND THE EMAIL IS NOT CONSULTED. An
 * authenticated Inventory AI session is the primary proof for an explicit
 * "Connect provider" operation (Phase 32F §14A.4), so a caller who holds one has
 * already established that they own the account being linked. The verified
 * identity's email is read for NOTHING here — not compared against the account's
 * email, not used to find the account, not used to resolve a conflict. That is
 * decision R-4/R-9 in force rather than restated: email is not an
 * account-linking join key, and a provider that supplies no address (Facebook,
 * per R-10) must link exactly as well as one that does.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CHANGES A TENANT OR A ROLE. The only fields this module ever
 * writes are `firebaseUid` and `emailVerified`; `businessId`, `role` and `status`
 * are read for the audit row and are never assigned. A link cannot move an
 * account between businesses or promote it, because there is no code path that
 * writes either field.

 *
 * The four lifecycle cases (Phase 32H §8) are handled in the order below, and the

 * `firebaseUid` before the identity is ever looked up, so an account that already
 * owns an identity can never have its own mapping queried, compared or replaced.
 *
 *   CASE A — the identity is already this account's. Idempotent: no write, no
 *            audit row (recording an event that did not happen is a false trail,
 *            the same reasoning `revokeSessionByJti` uses), and `linked: false`.
 *   CASE D — this account already owns a DIFFERENT identity. Refused. The
 *            existing mapping is never silently replaced: swapping it would hand
 *            a stranger's Firebase account the ability to sign in as this user,
 *            which is exactly the takeover this module exists to prevent.
 *            Decided BEFORE the lookup below, so this case costs no query and can
 *            never be reported as CASE B.
 *   CASE B — the identity already belongs to another MongoDB user. Refused and
 *            audited. NEVER merged, and the uid is NEVER transferred: the
 *            account it currently belongs to keeps it untouched.
 *   CASE C — the identity belongs to nobody. Attached — which is only safe
 *            because the caller has already proved they own THIS account.
 *
 * THE EMAIL IS NEVER A JOIN KEY, in any of the four. A verification whose email
 * matches the account's is not detected, preferred or treated specially; an email
 * that matches a different account is not a reason to look that account up. That
 * is what makes "no automatic linking on an address match" a property of the
 * code's shape rather than of a check someone could delete.
 *
 * Returns the account as it now stands plus whether this call changed anything.
 * `linked: false` is not a failure — it is the CASE A answer, and the caller
 * reports it as the success it is.
