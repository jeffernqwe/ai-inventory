// AI-23 — the compare-two-locations question, answered by ONE lookup.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES, measured on the device 2026-10-19. After AI-22 taught the model to
// batch its lookups, the owner's own question — *"Compare my two locations, how many
// products are in each?"* — still cost **3 provider calls / 29.3 s** (`calls=3 toolRuns=3
// tools=listLocations,getProductsByLocation`, `in=14037`). The reason is not batching: the
// member said "my two locations" and never named them, so the model had to spend a call
// learning the names (`listLocations`) before it could ask about one location at a time.
// No batching rule can fix that, because the second lookup cannot be phrased until the
// first one answers. The fix is a CAPABILITY: one read that reports, for every location at
// once, how many products it holds and how much stock is on its shelves.
//
// WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, and why each case is here:
//   * the numbers are exact, per location, and a product held in two places counts once in
//     each but ONCE in the business total (double counting across locations is the obvious
//     way to get this wrong);
//   * an EMPTY location is still reported, with zeros — "which location is empty" is a
//     question this tool exists to answer, and an absent row reads as an error;
//   * an ARCHIVED location still reports the stock it holds (archiving retains inventory;
//     hiding it would understate the business's stock);
//   * another tenant's locations and stock never appear;
//   * the tool takes NO arguments, so there is nothing for a model to smuggle a
//     `businessId` into — the strictest possible schema.
//
// DB-free cases first (schema and permission), then the behaviour against real MongoDB.
