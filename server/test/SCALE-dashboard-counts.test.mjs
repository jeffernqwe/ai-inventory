// SCALE — the dashboard's health counts stay exact, and stay computed in the database.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-10-14 a real tenant was measured at **50 625 products /
// 101 374 inventory rows** and the dashboard took **3 983–5 422 ms** (413 ms at 10 000
// products the day before). The old implementation answered correctly, so no existing
// test was red: it fetched the ENTIRE catalogue into the API process, built a Map of
// per-product availability from a second full inventory scan, and counted in
// JavaScript — ~200 000 documents moved per dashboard load to produce six integers.
// The rewrite computes the same six integers in one aggregation that returns a single
// document. `perf:golden` proved the rewrite output-identical on that 50 625-product
// tenant (17/17 cases byte-for-byte); this suite guards the two things a golden capture
// cannot: that the NUMBERS are right on a dataset built to hit every branch at once,
// and that the shape which shipped the catalogue to the process cannot come back
// unnoticed.
//
// The dataset is deliberately small and hand-counted — five numbers, every branch
// named — because the point is the arithmetic, not the volume. Volume is what the
// timing harnesses measure, and a test that asserted seconds would be flaky.
