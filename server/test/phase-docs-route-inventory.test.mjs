/**
 * §27AX — documentation-drift guard for the route inventory.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-18-firebase-auth-design.md` §2.6 states how many
 * routes the application mounts and how they split across the Phase 23 buckets. That sentence is
 * prose: it cannot fail a build, so it drifted. On 2026-10-12 it said **68** routes when the mounted
 * set was **72** — AUTH-03 (`POST /api/auth/renew`), AUTH-04 (`POST /api/auth/email-verification/request`
 * and `/confirm`) and the N-4 credential-change bridge (`POST /api/auth/credentials-changed`) had all
 * shipped without the figure being re-read. Nothing detected it for ten days, because no test read a
 * document.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY TWO INDEPENDENT METHODS AGREE. This file never imports the application.
 * It classifies the **declarations** in `server/src/routes/*.ts` plus the routes registered directly
 * on the app in `server/src/app.ts`. The Phase 23 guard classifies the **same set** from the mounted
 * router stacks at runtime (`router.stack`). Two different layers, two different techniques, one
 * number (85 on 2026-10-25): 50 permission-gated + 14 authenticated + 21 public + 0 role-gated. If the two ever
 * disagree, one of them is wrong and this file says so rather than quietly passing.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It asserts nothing about authorization. The classification is deliberately a
 * *source-text* one — `requireAuth(`, `requirePermission(`, `requireRole(` in the declaration — and
 * the phase 23/24 guards remain the authority for what those gates actually do at runtime. This file
 * exists to keep a documented number honest, and nothing more.
 *
 * FAIL LOUDLY ON REFORMATTING, NOT SILENTLY. If §2.6's sentence is reworded so the figures can no
 * longer be read, the parser returns `null` and the first case fails with the sentence it wanted.
 * A guard that shrugged at an unparseable document would be decoration; the alternative — a loose
 * regex that matched a reworded sentence and compared the wrong numbers — would be worse.
