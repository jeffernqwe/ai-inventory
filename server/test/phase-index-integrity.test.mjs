// Index integrity — the DECLARATIONS actually reach the DATABASE.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Four increments rest on a database index for their entire
// payoff: Phase 20G/20H (the list-sort keys), Phase 22/AI-3 (the inventory page
// sort `{ businessId: 1, updatedAt: -1, _id: -1 }`, worth ~6.3 s per page at
// 10 000 products), and the TTL keys on sessions / password-reset tokens /
// verification challenges (which are what actually expire rows). Each already has a
// suite — but every one of those suites reads the MODEL SOURCE, so they can only
// prove an index is DECLARED. **Not one of them can fail if the database never built
// it**, and the build path is Mongoose's default `autoIndex`, asserted nowhere:
// `grep -rn "autoIndex\|syncIndexes\|createIndexes" src/ scripts/` finds nothing.
//
// A missing index is therefore the perfect silent regression: the application keeps
// working, every test stays green, and the only symptom is that a query is slow or a
// collection grows without bound.
//
// WHY IT IS SAFE TO ASSERT HERE. The suite clears data with `deleteMany` (never
// `dropDatabase`), so indexes persist between runs; and `Model.init()` is AWAITED
// before the comparison, so a fresh CI database cannot race a background index
// build. `init()` rejecting is itself a real failure worth surfacing — a unique
// index that cannot be built because the data violates it.
//
// ORDER MATTERS AND IS COMPARED. `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` and `{ b: 1, a: 1 }` are different
// indexes: a compound index only serves a query whose equality/sort keys are a
// PREFIX of its own key order. Comparing the field set instead of the sequence would
// report `ok` for an index that cannot answer the query it was added for, which is
// exactly the failure this file exists to catch. (The standalone `audit:indexes`
// tool shipped with this increment had that defect in its first draft: it sorted the
// fields and printed the AI-3 key as `_id:-1,businessId:1,updatedAt:-1` while the
// declaration read `businessId:1,updatedAt:-1,_id:-1`.)
//
// Extras are NOT asserted absent: an index the database carries but the model does
// not declare is usually harmless, and failing on one would make this suite break
// for a reason that is not a defect.
//
// DB-backed; fails loudly when MongoDB is unreachable (Phase 07F / M9).
