// §27DF — the STOCK LIST's query shape, pinned at the size that broke it.
//
// WHAT HAPPENED. On the 131 000-product tenant (261 918 inventory rows) four assistant
// tools — `getLowStockProducts`, `getOutOfStockProducts`, `getReorderNeededProducts`,
// `getProductsByLocation` — returned `TOOL_ERROR`, and `GET /api/products?lowStock=true`
// (the Inventory and Restock screens) returned a 500, with MongoDB's own sentence:
//
//     Exceeded memory limit for $group, but didn't allow external sort.
//     Pass allowDiskUse:true to opt in.
//
// The merge that computes per-product availability is ONE `$group` over the union of the
// catalog and its inventory rows, and `$group` memory is memory PER GROUP — so the cost
// was never the row count, it was the PAYLOAD: the first version carried the whole product
// document (`__product: '$$ROOT'`) through that group, i.e. the catalog in RAM.
//
// WHY A SOURCE GUARD IS THE ONLY HONEST TEST. Both halves of the fix are invisible to a
// functional test: the merge now publishes four scalars and hydrates the page afterwards,
// and every catalog aggregation opts into disk spilling as a backstop. A suite over a
// small tenant passes on both shapes — it did, before and after. The properties that
// distinguish them are structural, and the same is true of the two facts measured the
// same day for the inventory list:
//
//   * `outOfStock` is ROW-LOCAL (`available <= 0`), so it must not be routed through the
//     per-row product join — that routing cost 5.4 s for a 15-row page and ~0.6 s after;
//   * `lowStock` must prefilter rows against the largest `minimumStock` in the business
//     BEFORE the join, which is exact (a row above the maximum threshold cannot satisfy
//     `available <= minimumStock` for any product) and keeps 147 225 of 261 918 rows out
//     of the join.
//
// Every checker below carries an in-memory POSITIVE CONTROL: a checker that cannot fail is
// decoration, so each one is run against a mutated copy of the source it reads and must
// report the mutation. Nothing is written to disk by this file.
